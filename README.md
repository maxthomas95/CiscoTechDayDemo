# CiscoTechDayDemo ðŸ”§ Meraki Automation Demo | Presented at Cisco Tech Days Milwaukee, 2025

This script demonstrates how to securely connect to the Meraki Dashboard API using credentials stored in **Azure Key Vault**, retrieve a list of devices in an organization, and export them to a CSV for auditing or inventory purposes.

It's designed to show how easy it is to automate network visibility tasks using Python, Merakiâ€™s REST API, and cloud-based secrets management.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Authenticates securely to Azure using a service principal  
- Retrieves a Meraki API key from Azure Key Vault  
- Connects to the Meraki Dashboard API  
- Fetches all devices in a specified organization  
- Writes a CSV with device info: Name, Model, Serial, MAC, Status, IP, Firmware

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- Azure service principal credentials with access to Key Vault  
- A Meraki API key stored in Azure Key Vault  
- `.env` file with the following environment variables:
```env
AZURE_TENANT_ID=
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=
ORGANIZATION_ID=
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

Manual inventory and audit tasks slow teams down. With just a few lines of Python, you can automate repetitive tasks, improve visibility, and integrate with secure cloud services like Azure Key Vault.

## ðŸ§ª What's Next

This demo is just the beginning â€” more scripts may be added here in the future to showcase Meraki configuration checks, policy audits, or health reports.
